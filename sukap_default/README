This module combines the "smallnt" and "mtuple" software used 
to create reduced ROOT trees for use in T2K oscillation analyses.

The code should be run on T2K-SK MC with the following format:

./build_minituple [t2k mc reg. expression] [channel] [fluxfile] [use n50-dt cut or not] |outfile.name| 


Here [t2k mc reg. expression] is a regular expression indicating a collection of 
files to be processed. That is these files will be added to a TTree for processing.

[channel] is an integer corresponding to the type of input MC:

  1:'numu'            
  2:'numubar'         
  3:'nue'             
  4:'nuebar'          
  5:'nue_x_numuflx'   

[fluxfile] is the fullpath to a flux tuning file containing histograms of the form:
enu_sk_tuned11b_[flavor] 

[use n50-dt cut or not] is a switch for the n50-dt cut to reduce the neutron background in fQ decay e candidates

|outfile.name| is an optional argument to specify the output ROOT file.

A full usage example is presented in the pyscr/run.py file.

Please note the following points.

1) NC events in the nue_x_numu (appearance signal) are ignored 

2) The code stores any event that passes one of the official T2K-SK event selections
(currently 1 ring e-like, 1 ring mu-like, and 2-ring pi0) to the same output tree. 
Events in the output can be differentiated by the use of the "iclass" variable 
(see globalVars.h for details).
